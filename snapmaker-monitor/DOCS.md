This add-on runs a python script, which collects the the current status from
the Snapmaker 2.0 3D-Printer API and sends it to a Home Assistant webhook.

I refactored and modified the original [version][original-script] of the script from [NiteCrwlr](https://github.com/NiteCrwlr)

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Add" button to add the add-on repository.
1. Install the add-on "Snapmaker Monitor" from the Add-on Store
1. Set your snapmaker ip in the configuration
1. Check the logs of the "Snapmaker Monitor" add-on to see if everything went
   well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
ha_token: >-
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiI2Y2U0ZWI3NDQ0MDI0MWE2YWIzMzE5YjUzNTkxMGZmMSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA5NTc4MSwiZXhwIjoyMDY5NDU1NzgxfQ.6dXkjxX2Iu8kCaIf6ngG-NKLfqnAFsCnj6oKWGgcum8
ha_webhook_url: https://homeassistant.local:8123/api/webhook/wh-snapmaker
sm_ip: 192.168.0.10
sm_port: "8080"
log_level: info
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ha_token`

The Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token. Used to authenticate with Home Assistant.

### Option: `ha_webhook_url`

The webhook URL that the script will use to send updates to Home Assistant.

### Option: `sm_ip`

The IP address of your Snapmaker 2.0 printer.

### Option: `sm_port`

The port number of your Snapmaker 2.0 printer api. The default is `8080`.
